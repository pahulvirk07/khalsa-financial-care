            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                At Khalsa Financial Care, our mission is to empower new Punjabi immigrants with the financial knowledge and tools necessary to thrive in America. We provide accessible and culturally relevant financial literacy education.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded by Pahul Virk and Amrit Mann, we understand the unique challenges faced by immigrant families. Our personal experiences have highlighted the urgent need for financial literacy among new arrivals. This inspired us to create an organization that helps individuals navigate their financial journeys with confidence.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
                We envision a community where every new immigrant is equipped with the knowledge to make informed financial decisions. By providing education on essential topics such as budgeting, saving, investing, and retirement planning, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap and foster financial independence.
            </p>
